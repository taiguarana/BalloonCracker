# BalloonCracker

This is a simple game inspired by those puzzle games such Candy Crush and Diamond something.
I did it on my internship in Unkasoft (Spain, 2013) to show a preview of a product requested by one of its clients.
The main theme was another and I changed that, but the functionality is the same.

* I used the javascript toolkit "Caat" and HTML5
* It was made to run on mobiles, however you can also play on your web browser if you want.
* Although the design and gameplay are poor, I think the algorithm to make all the balloons with the same color around the one you clicked/touched disappear is worth seeing!! =D (At least I did it all alone and took some time to figure out how to do it. It was so cool try to create this algorithm by myself!! \o/)
